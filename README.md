## What is git-rekt?

Git-rekt is a plugin for git that will squash a project into a single commit. The current states of each branch will remain intact, but the history will be thoroughly rekt, which could be quite helpful for large repositories that take up a large amount of system memory.

## How do I install git-rekt?

Git-rekt can be installed simply using the included install.sh script:
    
    sudo sh install.sh
    
Installation instructions are also packaged with the plugin.

## How do I use git-rekt?

Git-rekt can be used like any other git plugin, i.e. go to the repository that you wish to rek, and simply input
    
    git rekt
    
This will give you the option of whether you are sure you want to rek the repository, and like any good program it will remove all history independent of your input. I suggest trying git rekt on the git-rekt source repository that you installed the plugin from. Compare the commit history before and after the use of git rekt and be astounded at how history vanishes in front of your eyes.
